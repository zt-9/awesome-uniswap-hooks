## ü§î Introduction

Uniswap v4 Hooks -- also known simply as hooks -- are specially designed contracts that run at distinct points throughout a pool action's lifecycle. They serve as plugins allowing developers to tailor how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact. This enables innovation atop Uniswap v4's core features, thereby supporting the development of custom AMM pools.

_These resources will help you get started with Uniswap v4 hooks._

- [Uniswap's v4 Announcement](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4): Official announcement article from Uniswap detailing their vision for v4, including the introduction of hooks.
- [Uniswap v4 Developer Documents](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/): Official V4 Developer Documents from Uniswap Foundation, covering topics including how developer would begin to start building out hooks on local testnets in order to start testing out hook designs.
- [Core smart contracts of Uniswap v4](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core): The core smart contracts of Uniswap v4, highlighting `v4-core`'s singleton-style architecture, the management of all pool state in `PoolManager.sol`, and use of hook contracts to implement callbacks in the lifecycle of pool actions.
- [Peripheral smart contracts for interacting with Uniswap v4](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery): `v4-periphery` hosts the logic that builds on top of the core pool logic like hook contracts, position managers, and even possibly libraries needed for integrations. It is still under development and is being updated as the v4 ecosystem matures. Includes the `BaseHook` contract that can be used as a base for creating custom hooks.
- [Draft Technical Whitepaper for Uniswap v4 Core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/whitepaper-v4-draft.pdf): Covers an introduction to Uniswap v4, hooks, singleton and flash accounting, native ETH, and other notable features.

## üîÑ Lifecycle

During the course of a pool action's lifecycle, a hook invokes custom logic primarily at four critical phases:

1. **Initialize**: Activated when the pool is deployed.
2. **Modify Position**: Used to add or remove liquidity.
3. **Swap**: Engages a swap between tokens within the V4 ecosystem.
4. **Donate**: Facilitates the donation of liquidity to a V4 pool.
   Upon initialization, a pool can be associated with a hook contract. Such a contract has the ability to execute any of the callback functions during the pool action's lifecycle:

- `{before,after}Initialize`
- `{before,after}AddLiquidity`
- `{before,after}RemoveLiquidity`
- `{before,after}Swap`
- `{before,after}Donate`

Moreover, hooks can determine fees on swaps and liquidity withdrawals through callback functions. The flexibility lies in updating the fee values or callback logic based on the hook's design. Nevertheless, the callbacks activated on a pool, including the fee type, remain constant post pool initialization.

## üîß Functionalities

_Hooks foster creativity. Here are some interesting functionalities that could be implemented with hooks._

- Onchain limit orders that fill at tick prices
- Dynamic fees rooted in volatility or other determinants
- Channeling out-of-range liquidity into lending platforms
- Autocompounding LP fees reintegrated into the LP positions
- MEV profits being internally distributed back to liquidity providers
- A time-weighted average market maker TWAMM to execute large orders over time
- Creation of bespoke onchain oracles (i.e., median, truncated), like geomean oracles

## üìú Examples

_A collection of hooks from Uniswap and community developers._

### From Uniswap

- [Full Range](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/FullRange.sol): A hook that allows a Uniswap pool to provide liquidity for a range of prices. This can be used to create a market maker for a volatile asset or to provide more liquidity for a thin market.
- [Geomean Oracle](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/GeomeanOracle.sol): A unique hook making a Uniswap pool function as an oracle. The geomean price is calculated using the prices of the assets in the pool. This can be used to get a more accurate price for an asset than a single oracle.
- [Limit Order](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/LimitOrder.sol): A hook that allows users to place limit orders. This means that they can specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. If the market price reaches the limit price, the order will be executed.
- [TWAMM](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/TWAMM.sol): A TWAMM (Time Weighted Average Market Maker) is a type of market maker that uses time-weighted averages to calculate the prices of assets. This can be used to reduce the volatility of the market and to provide more accurate prices for assets. See also [Uniswap's research blog post on TWAMM](https://blog.uniswap.org/v4-twamm-hook).
- [Volatility Oracle](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/example-contracts/contracts/hooks/examples/VolatilityOracle.sol): A volatility oracle is a contract that provides information about the volatility of an asset. This information can be used to price options and other derivatives.
- [Truncated Oracle](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/blob/trunc-oracle/contracts/hooks/TruncGeoOracle.sol): A truncated oracle is an onchain price oracle that records the price of an asset in a Uniswap liquidity pool using the geometric mean formula. See also [Uniswap's research blog post on truncated oracles](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4-truncated-oracle-hook).

### From Community

- [Multi-Sig](https://github.com/atj3097/mfa-multisig-hook-v4/tree/main): Requires multiple signatures for certain pool actions, such as adding or removing liquidity. This can be used to add an extra layer of security to a pool.
- [Whitelist](https://github.com/atj3097/whitelist-hook): Restricts pool participation to a whitelist of approved addresses. This can be used to prevent certain people from participating in a pool, such as people who have been banned from the platform or people who are considered to be high-risk traders.
- [Old Account](https://github.com/jdubpark/Uniswap-Hooks/blob/main/contracts/OldAccountHook.sol): Allows only old accounts to use the pool. Old is subjective; it's the hook owner's job to define "old".
- [KYC](https://github.com/jdubpark/Uniswap-Hooks/blob/main/contracts/KYCHook.sol): Allows for Know Your Customer (KYC) checks to be performed on users before they are allowed to trade on a pool. This can be used to prevent fraud and ensure that only legitimate users are able to trade.

- [Stop Loss Order](https://github.com/saucepoint/v4-stoploss): Allows users to place stop loss orders on their positions. This means that the position will be automatically closed if the price reaches a certain level.
- [Liquidity Provider Fee Rebate](https://github.com/jdubpark/Uniswap-Hooks/blob/main/contracts/LPFeeRebateHook.sol): Allows liquidity providers (LPs) to receive a rebate on the fees they pay when swapping tokens on a pool. This can be used to incentivize LPs to provide liquidity to the pool.
- [On-Chain Take Profit Order](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/uniswap-v4-take-profits-hook): Allows users to place automatically executing on-chain "take-profit" orders. This means that the position will be automatically closed if the price reaches a certain level.
- [Hyperlane LPTs](https://github.com/saucepoint/v4-hyperlane-LPTs): Automates LPTs on destination chains using Hyperlane in hooks. This can be used to provide liquidity to new tokens on new chains in a more efficient and secure way.
